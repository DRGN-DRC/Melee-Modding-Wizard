# GIMP gimprc
# 
# This is a custom gimprc file for the Tri-CSP Creator.  Any variable defined in this 
# file takes precedence over the value defined in the system-wide gimprc: 
# 	C:\Program Files\GIMP 2\etc\gimp\2.0\gimprc
# Most values can be set within GIMP by changing some options in the Preferences dialog.
#
# The purpose of this file is to prevent export of color profiles during GIMP's 
# 'pdb.file_png_save2' method, which does not itself have an option to do so.

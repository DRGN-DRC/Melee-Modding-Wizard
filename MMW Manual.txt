	Here you'll find an overview of the things that you can modify using this 
	program. This includes details on features and tools that may not be self-
	evident or as easy to find in the GUI.

Many features may be self-evident or easy to find, 
	but there are some that may not be 
	obvious. 

	There are also some program settings in the "settings.ini" file 
	that aren't present in the GUI (covered in detail below). For more advanced 
	usage, you can also use various features through command line. For details 
	on that, see the "Command-Line Usage.txt" file.


		Main Features so far:

			Disc Management
			Disc Details Editor
			Textures Editor
			Code Manager
			Code Construction
			20XX Menu Editor
			Stage Editor
			Music Manager
			Sound Effect Editor
			Character Modding

		Tools:


	 Disc Management:
	------------------

	    This can be used to operate on disc files or Root Folders (discs that have 
	    been extracted into its individual files). 

		- Export / Export Files(s): Exports one or more currently selected files.
		  See the "Use Disc Convenience Folders with File Exports" for details.
		- Import / Import File: Import a single file, replacing the currently 
		  selected file.
		- Auto Import: Import multiple files (selected by the user). Unlike with 
		  the single-file import method above, this doesn't use a current selection 
		  to determine a file to import over. Instead, each file will be identified 
		  by dat file symbols or file name to determine a file to replace.
		- Restore to Vanilla: This is a handy feature which replaces the currently 
		  selected file (or files) with a copy of the file from a vanilla NTSC 
		  copy of the game. You'll need to provide the program a filepath to this 
		  vanilla disc just the first time that you use any feature that needs it. 
		- Browse Textures: Like in DTW, this opens the file in a new tab, allowing 
		  you to see the file's textures and edit them (see Textures Editor section).
		- Add File(s) to Disc: Adds one or more files to the disc, not replacing 
		  any current files. If only one file is provided, you will also be prompted 
		  to choose a new filename. Otherwise, the files will all use their original 
		  filename. If a file is currently selected in the Disc File Tree, the new 
		  file(s) will be added just before it. If a folder is selected, the new 
		  file(s) will be added to the end of that folder. However, since it's 
		  likely a convenience folder (one not actually in the disc), the behavior  
		  is to add to the disc before the first file following the folder.
		- Rename (in disc filesystem): This renames the internal game name of the 
		  file. It's recommended to not use this unless you know what you're doing.
		- Edit Description (in yaml): As you might guess, this updates what's shown 
		  in the Description column of the Disc File Tree. These descriptions can 
		  be anything and will not hurt anything if they're updated. This is a 
		  shortcut to editing the '\File Descriptions\GALE01.yaml' file, which 
		  contains the disc's file descriptions, besides some dynamically generated 
		  ones.
		- Delete Selected Item(s): Completely removes the file from the disc. Not 
		  recommended unless you're sure the game won't reference it at all.
		- View Hex: Opens a file in your hex editor of choice.
		- Copy Offset(s) to Clipboard: Copies the offsets of all currently selected 
		  files to your clipboard.


	 Disc Details Editor
	---------------------

	    This edi

	    This provides a simple way to modify the metadata of a disc, such as Game ID, 
	    banner, Image Name, titles, and game descriptions. This is accessed by the 
	    "Edit Disc Details" button, on the top-right side of the Disc File Tree tab.
	    Most data here is read by various GC/Wii game launchers. Hover over 
	    any particular field in the interface to learn what uses it and what disc file 
	    the info is actually stored in.

	    The "Encoding" option does not change the region of the disc or any data in it, 
	    it is only used for parsing/decoding information on this tab.


	 Tools:
	--------


	 Program Settings:
	-------------------

		- Use Disc Convenience Folders:
			This organizes files of certain types into folders. This is 
			useful because these folders do not actually exist in the disc,
			which normally results in one very long list of files.

		- Use Disc Convenience Folders with File Exports:
			Adds a heirachy of folders (matching the conveneince folders 
			shown) when files are export. If this is turned off, all files
			will simply be output into the same folder selected from the GUI.

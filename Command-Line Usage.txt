    >==-------------
    >=- Overview
    >==----------

	Most of the command-line functionality is organized into a few "Operation Groups", which
	must be specified to access specific features. For example:

		"MMW.exe disc --discPath [filePath] --info"

	In this case, "disc" is the operation group name. Here is a short description of each
	group and the operations/arguments within them. Switches that are specific to one of these 
	features are not included here. See the sections below for more detail on a specifc operation.
	Details for specific op groups can also be viewed using the command "MMW.exe [opGroup] -h".

	You may use the full argument name, e.g. "--build", or a shorthand version of it, shown in
	parenthesis below (e.g. "-b" instead of "--build").

	    = Disc Operations
		--build (-b)		Build a disc from extracted root files
		--export (-e)		Export files from a disc
		--import (-i)		Import files to a disc
		--listFiles (-l)	List all files in a disc
		--info (-n)		Show information on a given disc

	    = Test Operations
		--boot			Boot test a given stage/character in Dolphin
		--validate		Test whether files are of an expected type

WIP!	    = Code Operations
		--install		Install a list of given mods
		--library		Specify the library to install from (if not using default)


	These arguments are exceptions, and do not require an operation group:

		--help (-h)		Show the program's help message and exit
		--version (-v)		Show program's version number and exit

	--boot (-b) [		Input: Single file path
		If you use this command with a stage or character file, that file will be loaded 
		into a mostly-vanilla mini disc, and loaded in the Dolphin instance you've provided. 
		The game will be booted directly into a match with the given stage or character 
		for immediate testing.
	--debug (-d)		Flag
		Use this flag to run Dolphin in Debug Mode when using the --boot command above.

	--validate (-v)		Input: One or more file paths (space-separated)
		Validate files to determine if they are of an expected type. By default, this will 
		attempt to validate them as "dat" files, however you may change this using the 
		--validationType command to be more specific. You may pass one or more file paths to 
		this command. Or you may instead provide a JSON file or JSON-formatted string for input.

		For example:
			MMW.exe test --validate "C:\\TestFiles\\PlCaNr.dat"
				or
			MMW.exe test --validate "C:\\TestFiles\\PlCaNr.dat" "C:\\TestFiles\\PlCa.dat" etc.
				or
			MMW.exe test --validate "C:\\TestFiles\\PlCaNr.dat" --validationType character

		(See the --validationType command below for other possible types.)

		There are two formats you may use for JSON files or the JSON-formatted string:

		1)

		   {
		      "D:\\Tex\\Misc. Textures\\Characters\\Peasent Soldier\\PlFeGr v2.0.dat": "character",
		      "D:\\Tex\\SSBM ISO\\vanilla test iso\\PlCaAJ.dat": "character"
		   }

		or 2)

		   [
		      {
		         "Path": "D:\\Tex\\Misc. Textures\\Characters\\Peasent Soldier\\PlFeGr v2.0.dat",
		         "Expected Type": "stage"
		      },
		      {
		         "Path": "D:\\Tex\\Misc. Textures\\Characters\\Peasent Soldier\\PlFeGr v2.0.dat",
		         "Expected Type": "character"
		      },
		      {
		         "Path": "D:\\Tex\\SSBM ISO\\vanilla test iso\\PlCaAJ.dat",
		         "Expected Type": "character"
		      }
		   ]

		The first form is simpler, but the second form guarantees order is preserved in output 
		and allows for duplicate filepaths (to test the same file for multiple types).

	--validationType (-vt)		Input: One or more file types
		Provide the expected file type(s) for the --validate command. If only one type is given,
		all of the given paths will be expected to be that type. Or you may provide a list of 
		types; one for each file path given. The default if this command is not used is "dat". 
		Other allowable validation types are "music", "menu", "stage", and "character". This 
		option is ignored when using JSON input.

	--outputJsonFile (-ojf)		Input: Single file path
		Provide a filepath to output a JSON results file for the --validate command.

	--outputJsonString (-ojs)	Flag
		Output JSON results on stdout as a string when using the --validate command. 
		Usage of this option will disable the normal file status printout.
